# BetterReachability

BetterReachability makes the Reachability feature on iOS more useful by scaling down the interface.

This is a fork of original https://github.com/shiftcmdk/BetterReachability

This fork could be used by those who have unresponsible part of their damaged iOS device screen.

This is created and optimized especially for my old iPad with broken unresponsible lower part of the screen (about 2cm height, covering dashboard area near Home button), but it could be easily tweaked for your particular situation by ajusting appropriate numbers.

What is actually done here: scaled Reachibility screen is moved 102 pixels above home button, default scale is set to 75%.
